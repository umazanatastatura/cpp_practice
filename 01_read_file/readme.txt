Problem:
I want to read a .txt file and then show it to the screen.
Nothing special nor useful, just that for starters.


Learned:

01:
Code:Blocks - how to set static libs (libgcc, stdc++...):
Settings - Global compiler settings - Compiler settings tab - Compiler Flags undertab - here check these:
-static-libgcc
-static-libstdc++
-static

02:
Code:Blocks - comment/uncomment block of code:
Ctrl + Shift + C to comment selected block
Ctrl + Shift + X to uncomment selected block
